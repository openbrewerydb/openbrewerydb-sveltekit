We're announcing the deprecation of the `/v1/breweries/autocomplete` endpoint. This endpoint will be removed from v1 by the end of the year.

The reason for this deprecation is that this feature was not used much and was not as feature rich as the [Search endpoint](/documentation#search-breweries). We believe that the Search endpoint provides a better experience and is more feature rich.

If you're currently using the autocomplete endpoint, please migrate to the [Search endpoint](/documentation#search-breweries) instead.

For any questions or concerns about this change, please reach out to us on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/openbrewerydb-sveltekit/issues) or our Discord server.

We're announcing the deprecation of the `/breweries/autocomplete` endpoint. This endpoint will be removed from v1 by the end of the year.

If you're currently using the autocomplete endpoint, please migrate to the [Search endpoint](/documentation#search-breweries) instead. The Search endpoint provides similar functionality and will continue to be supported.

For any questions or concerns about this change, please reach out to us on [GitHub](https://github.com/openbrewerydb).

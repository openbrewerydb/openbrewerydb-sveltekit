We're excited to launch the new Open Brewery DB News and Changelog pages!

The [News](/news) section will be a new way to keep everyone up-to-date with the latest happenings. We'll be posting about new features, dataset updates, projects, and other items of interest. And yes, I do hope to update this more than I've sent out newsletter emails. ðŸ˜…

We've also added a [Changelogs](/changelogs) page, where you can track more granular updates to the [API](https://github.com/openbrewerydb/openbrewerydb-laravel-api/) and [dataset](https://github.com/openbrewerydb/openbrewerydb) synced with the GitHub repositories.

We hope these new pages will be a valuable resource for you. Stay tuned for more updates!

<RunButton endpoint="https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries?by_city=san_diego&per_page=3" />

### `by_dist`

Sort the results by distance from an origin point, denoted by

<RunButton endpoint="https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries?by_name=cooper&per_page=3" />

### `by_state`

Filter breweries by state.

**Note:** Full state name is required; no abbreviations. For the parameters, you can use underscores or [url encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) for spaces.

<RunButton endpoint="https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries?by_state=new_york&per_page=3" />

### `by_postal`

May be filtered by basic (5 digit) postal code or more precisely filtered by postal+4 (9 digit) code.

**Note:** If filtering by postal+4 the search must include either a hyphen or an underscore.

<RunButton endpoint="https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries?by_postal=44107&per_page=3" />

### `by_type`

Filter by type of brewery.

Must be one of:

- `micro` - Most craft breweries. For example, Samual Adams is still considered a micro brewery.
- `nano` - An extremely small brewery which typically only distributes locally.
- `regional` - A regional location of an expanded brewery. Ex. Sierra Nevada's Asheville, NC location.
- `brewpub` - A beer-focused restaurant or restaurant/bar with a brewery on-premise.
- `large` - A very large brewery. Likely not for visitors. Ex. Miller-Coors. (deprecated)
- `planning` - A brewery in planning or not yet opened to the public.
- `bar` - A bar. No brewery equipment on premise. (deprecated)
- `contract` - A brewery that uses another brewery's equipment.
- `proprietor` - Similar to contract brewing but refers more to a brewery incubator.
- `closed` - A location which has been closed.

**Note:** `by_dist` does not work with the `sort` filter since it is a filter of its own.

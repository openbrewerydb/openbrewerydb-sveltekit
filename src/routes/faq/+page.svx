## What is Open Brewery DB?

Open Brewery DB is a free dataset and API with public information on breweries, cideries, brewpubs, and bottleshops.

## Why Open Brewery DB?

The goal of this project is to keep an up-to-date, community-driven, and publically available database of breweries for the betterment of the beer community and the joy of web developers and data analysts.

## How did it start?

Open Brewery DB started after I wanted to create an interactive map of dog-friendly breweries. As I began the project, we realized there was no easy way to get data on breweries. While there are other websites and resources available, none had an easy-to-use, publically-accessible API. Open Brewery DB was born!

## Will Open Brewery DB always be free?

Yes! Absolutely, always, 100% free.

## How old is the data?

As of today (Sept 2020), the data is mostly from Summer 2018. It was scraped from [Brewers Association](https://www.brewersassociation.org/).

## How often is the data update?

I'm actively working on getting more up-to-date data. [Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/WMPB3VZ) if you'd liked to help out!

## Can I use Open Brewery DB for production use or for-profit?

At this time, I only advise using the API for personal projects. It's not very stable and is suseptible to outages due to DDoS attacks.

Note: Version 2 of the API will have basic authentication and rate limits. Timeline TBD.

You are welcome to use the [dataset](https://github.com/openbrewerydb/openbrewerydb/) for any projects with credit to Open Brewery DB.

## Why not use other location data services (Untappd, Google Maps, BreweryDB, Yelp, Foursquare, etc.)?

There is absolutely nothing wrong with those services. Some charge money for premium services, but it all depends on the goals of your project.
